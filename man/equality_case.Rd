\title{Equality case data}
\format{
A numerial data frame with 20 rows and  2 columns simulated from two gaussien distributions.
}
\description{
These data illstrate the case where two binary questions give the same bipartition and how
the binary question with the most discriminant variable (X1 here) is chosen.
}
\examples{
data(equality_case)
plot(equality_case) #X1 discriminates the bipartition better than X2
tree <- divclust(equality_case,K=3)
plot(tree,nqbin=1) # the binary question with X1 is chosen
}
